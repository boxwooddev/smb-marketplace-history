# SMB (Solana Monkey Business) Marketplace History

Tools to get information for SMB NFTs on Solana.

## Usage

To run the `realtime` service, set environment variable `REALTIME=1`.

## Notes

This project started as a way to learn about Solana and Metaplex. This version turned into the production code that the SMB team uses for their Sales History view on the marketplace.

_**The code provided is only focused on the SMB Marketplace and does not support other NFTs.**_

Certain decisions were made in a short time window and is not the most optimal way to determine distinguish between transactions.

The goal of open sourcing this project is to provide everyone with a view of how it was initially done.

A future repository will be provided that works with the SMB Marketplace, Solanart, and DigitalEyes (+ more).
